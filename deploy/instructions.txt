Due to some python bullshit, we can't script starting the renderer. So what you need to do is, from the ~ folder:
- start a new tmux session: `tmux new -s renderer`
- in the tmux session: `source activate tensorflow_p37; cd ./stylegan2-ada/; python dg_server.py --network=./network-snapshot-000008.pkl; ./deepgems_site/deploy/notifier.sh`
- detach from the session: Ctrl-b d
- now you can exit from the server and the server will run
